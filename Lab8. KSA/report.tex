    \chapter{Purpose of the lab}

        \paragraph{This lab aims to design 16bit Kogge Stone Adder with Verilog language. This report contains state diagrams, waveforms and verilog codes with test cases.}
    
        \section{Kogge Stone Adder}

        \paragraph{\normalfont Kogge Stone Adder is a sort of Carry Propagation Adder(CPA), generates carry output and sum with parallel carry look-ahead tree. It implements 'dot', which achieves associativity that enables to parallelize carry operations.}

        \paragraph{\normalfont In this lab, 16 bit Kogge Stone Adder will be implmeneted, which gets 2 16-bit sized inputs and carry-in, outputs 1 16-bit sized data and a bit of carry out.}

    \chapter{Evaluation}
        \paragraph{\normalfont For precise testing, $65535 \times 65535$ (4294836225) cases of testing were going to be executed - for each inputs, (0000000000000000 to 1111111111111111, about 43 seconds in modelsim time - however, too much time was taken therefore ns of test were actually executed. and the result was same as below:}


    \chapter{Discussions}
        \section{Key Part of This Lab}
            \paragraph{\normalfont There were 5 stages of Carry Look-Ahead tree, which has decreasing black cell operation for each stage, with regular count. each (P, G) pair is combined with previous inputs.}

        \section{Mistakes}
            \paragraph{\normalfont Because of the characteristics of KSA logic circuit, }

        \section{Expected Improvements}
            \paragraph{\normalfont Conditional branches are useful when designing modules in behavior form. However, Its mechanism is not exactly same as other C-like languages so different plotting is required when using it.}
